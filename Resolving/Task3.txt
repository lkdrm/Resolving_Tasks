Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. 
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. 
Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
